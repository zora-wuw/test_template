# Accounts

New and existing NCI users with stakeholder affiliation can register for an account or new project at our [MyNCI portal](https://my.nci.org.au/).  
Lead Chief Investigators can register a new project, and the Scheme Manager for the nominated allocation scheme will receive the new proposal in email. The Scheme Manager will review and decide if the proposal will be approved.

Prospective stakeholders can register interest in obtaining NCI services via NCI user support at [help@nci.org.au](mailto:help@nci.org.au). Please include contact details and a basic description of your requirements in your enquiry email. 

# Access Scheme

```{admonition} Find out if you have access
The easiest way is to ask your research project lead for any existing arrangement with NCI. If not, check with the scheme manager in your institute.
```
National Computational Merit Allocation Scheme
The National Computational Merit Allocation Scheme (NCMAS) provides researchers with annual access to Australia’s major national computational facilities, namely NCI and the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre, through a merit-based selection process. In total, NCMAS distributes around 700 million units of computing time to meritorious applicants from around Australia. The main call for applications is made annually in August-October to determine allocations for the following calendar year. Information and application materials are available through the [NCMAS portal](https://ncmas.nci.org.au/).

Other access schemes and methods can be found [here](https://www.nci.org.au/users/how-access-nci).

```{note}
Your account needs to be linked to a project to access NCI resources. Resources at NCI are allocated to projects and not to individual users.
